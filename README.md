I am a computer science student at Carleton University.  
I like writing code, learning about algorithms and working on side-projects. 👩‍💻

🔭 **I’m currently working on:** studying databases, algorithms, and why technology was inherently built **against** the interests of underrepresented populations in my 2B term of Software Engineering/Human-Computer Interaction.

🌱 **I’m currently learning about:** how technologies have influenced human psychology and behaviour, the ethics of technology and its impacts on marginalized groups, and how to use React and external APIs to solve my everyday problems with software.

👯 **I'm currently having fun with:** working out! I love rhythmic cycling and other forms of group fitness, as well as yoga, boxing, and running. Join me in a form of virtual fitness!
